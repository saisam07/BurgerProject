## Modules

The main parts of the project are:

* **core**: Java bundle containing all core functionality like OSGi services, listeners or schedulers, as well as component-related Java code such as servlets or request filters.
* **ui.apps**: contains the /apps (and /etc) parts of the project, ie JS & CSS clientlibs, components, templates, runmode specific configs as well as Hobbes-tests
* **ui.content**: contains mutable content (not /apps) that is integral to the running of the BurgerStop site. This include template types, templates, policies and base-line organization page and asset structures.
* **it.tests**: Java bundle containing JUnit tests that are executed server-side. This bundle is not to be deployed onto production.
* **it.launcher**: contains glue code that deploys the it.tests bundle (and dependent bundles) to the server and triggers the remote JUnit execution


## How to build

To build all the modules run in the project root directory the following command with Maven 3:

    mvn clean install

To build all the modules and deploy the `all` package to a local instance of AEM, run in the project root directory the following command:

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage

Or to deploy it to a publish instance, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackagePublish

Or alternatively

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallSinglePackage -Daem.port=4503

Or to deploy only the bundle to the author, run

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallBundle

Or to deploy only a single content package, run in the sub-module directory (i.e `ui.apps`)

    mvn clean install -PautoInstallPackage

* unit test in core: this show-cases classic unit testing of the code contained in the bundle. To test, execute:

    ```
    mvn clean test
    ```

* server-side integration tests: this allows to run unit-like tests in the AEM-environment, ie on the AEM server. To test, execute:

    ```
    mvn clean verify -PintegrationTests
    ```

* client-side Hobbes.js tests: JavaScript-based browser-side tests that verify browser-side behavior. To test, go in the browser, open the page in 'Developer mode', open the left panel and switch to the 'Tests' tab and find the generated 'MyName Tests' and run them.
